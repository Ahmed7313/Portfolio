# Ancient Artifacts Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ancient Artifacts Portfolio! This project showcases my work, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase for real-time data handling. This portfolio includes detailed information about the projects I have worked on and features a dynamic display of project details using Firebase Realtime Database.
